            Red Thicket is a small rabbitry located in central Wisconsin specializing in Holland Lops, Satins, Mini Satins and Cinnamons.
            Our rabbitry, well it happened almost by accident. We always kept a rabbit or two as pets. Then my girl's entered 4-H. 
            I thought I'd start a small breeding program to help the girls get some nice show bunnies. One thing lead to another and the girls' interests changed. 
            So Mom's rogue 4-H project, turned hobby and now a growing business; Red Thicket Rabbitry was established.
