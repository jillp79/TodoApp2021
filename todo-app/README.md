## Overview

Simple "To do list" - This app allows a user to add a task, remove a task and review existing tasks. The user can view all todos, active todos or complete todos.

## Technologies used

React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Ant Design, Tailwind and Javascript

## Ideas for future improvement

Better styling of the app, make the UI a bit more visually appealing
Add the ability to store and retrieve multiple lists, so the user can make more than one and reference them
Set time limit goals for completing tasks. So if the user doesn't complete in the time allotted a reminder would pop up.

## User Stories

As a busy rabbitry owner, I want to add items to a list as they come up so I can reference the info later.

As a rabbitry worker, I want to add items to a list and be able to cross them off when I've completed.

As a rabbitry customer, I want to add, remove and view completed tasks so I can use it as a check list for buying a rabbit.

## Presentational & Container Components
Added Ant Design tabs for todo list - Active, All, Completed.

Added Ant Design contact form



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm Stop` terminates all node.js instances on the server.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
